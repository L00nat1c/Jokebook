## Another assignment I can't finish because I don't understand what I'm doing and I don't have any time to do it.

I'm currently a cashier at a Harris Teeter in High Point.
I also had another project for a different class that was due on the same day as this one.

I'll try to do what I can, but I can only work on this for maybe 3 hours today, so don't expect anything.
